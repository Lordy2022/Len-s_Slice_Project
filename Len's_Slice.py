# 1) To keep track of the kinds of pizzas you sell, create a list called toppings, that holds different types of pizza toppings:

toppings = ["pepperoni", "pineapple", "cheese", "sausage", "olives", "anchovies", "mushrooms"]

# 2) To keep track of how much each kind of pizza slice costs, create a list that holds the following integer values:

prices = [2, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, 2]

# 3) Your boss wants you to do some research on $2 slices. Count the number of occurrences of 2 in the prices list:

num_two_dollar_slices = prices.count(2)

# 4) Find the length of the toppings list:

num_pizzas = len(toppings)

# 5) Print the string We sell [num_pizzas] different kinds of pizza!, where [num_pizzas] represents the value of our variable num_pizzas:

print("We sell", num_pizzas, "different kinds of pizza!")

# 6) Use the existing data about the pizza toppings and prices to create a new two-dimensional list:

pizza_and_prices = [[ 2, "pepperoni"], [6, "pineapple"], [1, "cheese"], [3,	"sausage"], [2,	"olives"], [7, "anchovies"], [2, "mushrooms"]]

# 7) Print pizza_and_prices. Does it look the way you expect?: 

print(pizza_and_prices)

# 8) Sort pizza_and_prices so that the pizzas are in the order of increasing price:

pizza_and_prices.sort()

# 9) Store the first element of pizza_and_prices in a variable called cheapest_pizza:

cheapest_pizza = pizza_and_prices[0]

# 10) A man walks into the pizza store and shouts “I will have your MOST EXPENSIVE pizza!”:

priciest_pizza = pizza_and_prices[6] 

# 11) It looks like the most expensive pizza from the previous step was our very last "anchovies" slice. Remove it from our pizza_and_prices list since the man bought the last slice:

pizza_and_prices.pop()

# 12) Since there is no longer an "anchovies" pizza, you want to add a new topping called "peppers" to keep your customers excited about new toppings:

pizza_and_prices.insert(4, [2.5, "peppers"])

# 13) Three mice walk into the store. They don’t have much money (they’re mice) but, they do each want different pizzas. What are our three cheapest pizzas?:

three_cheapest = pizza_and_prices[:3]

# 14) Great job! The mice are very pleased and will be leaving you a 5-star review. Print the three_cheapest list:

print(three_cheapest)
